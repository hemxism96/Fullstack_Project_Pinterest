# Find Your Interest - Fullstack Project

This project is a fullstack application where we had to do backend and frontend with two different technologies.
We chose to use Flask for backend with MongoDB for the database and we used React for the frontend.

The site is close to Pinterest. We first have to sign up to create an account, then we can login. 
Having an account mean we can save a any photo on the page and add it to our favorite photos that we can access in our page.
